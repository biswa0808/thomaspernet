## Key Facts

China is a first class player in the world economy for the trade, growth, technology but China is also notorious for being a major polluter. China gradually became the world's No.1 carbon dioxide emitter few years after joing the WTO. There is no other country in the world with a sharp increase as China. In fact, major developed countries have either stabilized or reduced the carbon dioxide emission.

The carbon dioxide emission started to increase when China opened its economy to the world in 1978. A vital moment in the Chinese economy occured in 2001 with the accession to the WTO. China rapidly grow into the factory of the World, exporting goods and manuctured products everywhere in the world. In 2005, the Chinese economy dethroned the US in the merchandised exported. Since then, China never stopped to increase the gap with the other economies

A closer look between the emission of SO3 and the merchandirse exported by China despicted a clear positive correlation. The pollution in China is driven by the amount of merchandise exported to the rest of the world. In more recent year, the emission of carbon dioxide appears to slow down as it follow a decrease in the export.

The chinese economy is stressing an export-oriented growth model, with a predominance for processing activities. This economic system were relevant at the begining of the development stage but quickly reaches its limit. The leaders of China are fully aware that significant progress has to be achieved in the need for quality growth. Xi Jinping launched a series of reforms to improve the lack of coordination and a more inclusive, green, innovation-driven growth and pollution free industries.

In this paper, we propose to establish a link between the quality enhancement of the Chinese economy and its impact on the environment.

Quality can be proxy by price, although in this paper, we will compute a more sophisticated index, known as the Kandhelwal index. The graph below plots the relationship between the average price index of exported merchandise and the SO3 emission. The effect on price is not clear. We may be tempted to say the pollution level follows the price index, or a thiner analysis might reveal a more promising results.

## Quality and Environment

The Chinese economy is producing goods with better quality than ever. The shift toward better quality goods occured with the liberalization of the economy and a greater pool of firms engaged in the ordinary trade. Recents finding have highlighted that ordinary trade is not beneficial for the environment compared with processing trader. The objective of the paper is to show that ordinary trade can be helpful for the enviromnent when they make the effort of increasing the production structure.

- Does structural transformation has a positive impact on the environment?
- Adjustment mechanism
	- output quality depends on input quality and also implies a fixed cost for quality adjustment. Assume that producing high-quality outputs requires high-quality inputs.
	- quality increase with an increase in fixed quality investment: effectiveness of RD

We propose to build a theoretical model to explain the decrease in average pollution level:

- The average level of pollution decreases because of:
	- **Productivity effect**: Upgrade quality through better intermediate inputs and better production structure. two types of fixed cost:
		- quality upgrading in the green sector
		- Export
	- Firms that export quality upgraded products have higher productivity, ability to move toward cleaner industry, import better quality input
	
	- **Reallocation effect:** low productive firms in ordinary trade have two options:
        -   Self-section in the export market firms that can't pay the fixed cost to export the upgraded environmental quality products have two possibilities:
            -   reallocate to processing then lower pollution
        -   reallocate to ordinary polluting activity?
            -   reallocate to ordinary then constant or increase pollution
-   _Proposition 1_. An increase of the quality of the ordinary firms induces a reduction in the pollution level
-   _Proposition 2_: The least productive firms in ordinary activity produce polluting goods or switch to processing activity (less polluting) inducing a reduction in the pollution level

## Why is it Interesting? 

-   Chinese Trade: switch from low quality to middle-high quality
-   Chinese type of trade: Lower processing trade. Increase ordinary trade
-   Increase quality leads to more revenue and more growth.
    -   But, Sandra's [paper](https://docs.google.com/file/d/189RWGnxA2cNt4Idw1GAtMLrk5Y1iE6Cb/edit) shows ordinary trade does not improve the environment
    -   The effect is ambiguous.
-   Add the quality into the model to explore the relationship between structural transformation, and the environment.
-   The theoretical model shows an ambiguous effect in the firm selection: average ordinary vs processing: what effect prevail?
-   Interesting for the policymaker because they give incentives to move away from processing and want to fight pollution.
    -   This paper can provide both theoretical and empirical explanation

## Methodology

-   Level of analysis: city, industry and year.
-   pollution = quality + quality x status
-   use the SO2 emission Urban Statistical Yearbook, published by China’s State Statistical Bureau to compute the level of pollution at the industry level:
    -   Environmentally extended input-output of China. [Data](http://www.ceeio.com/)
    -   quality is computed using price index and “Khandelwal index.
