    "In this tutorial, we will estimate the median price using a linear\n",
    "regressor, but the focus is on one particular process of machine\n",
    "learning: \"data preparation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A model generalizes the pattern in the data. To capture such a pattern,\n",
    "you need to find it first. A good practice is to perform a data analysis\n",
    "before running any machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the right features makes all the difference in the success of\n",

    "not include the gender as a covariate, you end up with a poor\n",
    "estimate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to improve the model is to look at the correlation between\n",
    "the independent variable. Back to the example, you can think of\n",
    "education as an excellent candidate to predict the wage but also the\n",
    "occupation. It is fair to say, the occupation depends on the level of\n",
    "education, namely higher education often leads to a better occupation.\n",
    "If we generalize this idea, we can say the correlation between the\n",
    "dependent variable and an explanatory variable can be magnified of yet\n",
    "another explanatory variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the limited effect of education on occupation, we can use an\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/tensorflow/16_Linear_regression_case_study_v5_files/image001.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the wage equation, it becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$wage = \\alpha + \\beta_{1}occupation + \\beta_{2}education + \\beta_{3}occupation*education + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\beta_{3}$ is positive, then it implies that an additional level of\n",
    "education yields a higher increase in the median value of a house for a\n",
    "high occupation level. In other words, there is an interaction effect\n",
    "between education and occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will try to see which variables can be a good\n",
    "candidate for interaction terms. We will test if adding this kind of\n",
    "information leads to better price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few steps you can follow before proceeding to the model. As mentioned earlier, the model is a generalization of the data. The best practice is to understand the data and the make a prediction. If you do not know your data, you have slim chances to improve your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, load the data as a pandas dataframe and create a training set and testing set.\n",
