    "# Convolutional neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural network, also known as *convnets*, is a well-known\n",
    "method in computer vision applications. This type of architecture is\n",
    "dominant to recognize objects from a picture or video.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to construct a convnet and how to\n",
    "use TensorFlow to solve the handwritten dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about Facebook a few years ago, after you uploaded a picture to\n",
    "your profile, you were asked to add a name to the face on the picture\n",
    "manually. Nowadays, Facebook uses convnet to tag your friend in the\n",
    "picture automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional neural network is not very difficult to understand. An\n",
    "input image is processed during the convolution phase and later\n",
    "attributed a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical convnet architecture can be summarized in the picture below.\n",
    "First of all, an image is pushed to the network; this is called the\n",
    "input image. Then, the input image goes through an infinite number of\n",
    "steps; this is the convolutional part of the network. Finally, the\n",
    "neural network can predict the digit on the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/tensorflow/20_CNN_v7_files/image001.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "An image is composed of an array of pixels with height and width. A\n",
    "grayscale image has only one channel while the color image has three\n",
    "channels (each one for Red, Green, and Blue). A channel is stacked over\n",
    "each other. In this tutorial, you will use a grayscale image with only\n",
    "one channel. Each pixel has a value from 0 to 255 to reflect the\n",
    "intensity of the color. For instance, a pixel equals to 0 will show a\n",
    "white color while pixel with a value close to 255 will be darker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s have a look of an image stored in the [MNIST\n",
    "dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The picture below shows how\n",
    "to represent the picture of the left in a matrix format. Note that, the\n",
    "original matrix has been standardized to be between 0 and 1. For darker\n",
    "color, the value in the matrix is about 0.9 while white pixels have a\n",
    "value of 0.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Convolutional operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The most critical component in the model is the convolutional layer.\n",
    "This part aims at reducing the size of the image for faster computations\n",
    "of the weights and improve its generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the convolutional part, the network keeps the essential features\n",
    "of the image and excludes irrelevant noise. For instance, the model is\n",
    "learning how to recognize an elephant from a picture with a mountain in\n",
    "the background. If you use a traditional neural network, the model will\n",
    "assign a weight to all the pixels, including those from the mountain\n",
    "which is not essential and can mislead the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, a convolutional neural network will use a mathematical\n",
    "technique to extract only the most relevant pixels. This mathematical\n",
    "operation is called convolution. This technique allows the network to\n",
    "learn increasingly complex features at each layer. The convolution\n",
    "divides the matrix into small pieces to learn to most essential elements\n",
    "within each piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every convnets, there are four components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Non Linearity (ReLU)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Pooling or Sub Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Classification (Fully Connected Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the convolution is to extract the features of the object\n",
    "on the image locally. It means the network will learn specific patterns\n",
    "within the picture and will be able to recognize it everywhere in the\n",
    "picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is an element-wise multiplication. The concept is easy to\n",
    "understand. The computer will scan a part of the image, usually with a\n",
    "dimension of 3x3 and multiplies it to a filter. The output of the\n",
    "element-wise multiplication is called a feature map. This step is\n",
    "repeated until all the image is scanned. Note that, after the\n",
    "convolution, the size of the image is reduced.\n",
    "\n",

    "There are numerous channels available. Below, we listed some of the\n",
    "channels. You can see that each filter has a specific purpose. Note, in\n",

    "*Arithmetic behind the convolution*\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional phase will apply the filter on a small array of pixels\n",
    "within the picture. The filter will move along the input image with a\n",
    "general shape of 3x3 or 5x5. It means the network will slide these\n",
    "windows across all the input image and compute the convolution. The\n",
    "image below shows how the convolution operates. The size of the patch is\n",
    "3x3, and the output matrix is the result of the element-wise operation\n",
    "between the image matrix and the filter.\n",

    "You notice that the width and height of the output can be different from\n",

    "Image has a 5x5 features map and a 3x3 filter. There is only one window\n",
    "in the center where the filter can screen an 3x3 grid. The output\n",
    "feature map will shrink by two tiles alongside with a 3x3 dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/tensorflow/20_CNN_v7_files/image007.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the same output dimension as the input dimension, you need to add\n",
    "padding. Padding consists of adding the right number of rows and columns\n",
    "on each side of the matrix. It will allow the convolution to center fit\n",
    "every input tile. In the image below, the input/output matrix have the\n",
    "same dimension 5x5\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/tensorflow/20_CNN_v7_files/image008.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define the network, the convolved features are controlled by\n",
    "three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Depth: It defines the number of filters to apply during the\n",
    "    convolution. In the previous example, you saw a depth of 1, meaning\n",
    "    only one filter is used. In most of the case, there is more than one\n",
    "    filter. The picture below shows the operations done in a situation\n",
    "    with three filters\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/tensorflow/20_CNN_v7_files/image009.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Stride: It defines the number of \"pixel's jump\" between two slices.\n",
    "    If the stride is equal to 1, the windows will move with a pixel's\n",
    "    spread of one. If the stride is equal to two, the windows will jump\n",
    "    by 2 pixels. If you increase the stride, you will have smaller\n",
    "    feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example stride 1\n",

    "<img src=\"/tensorflow/20_CNN_v7_files/image011.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Zero-padding: A padding is an operation of adding a corresponding\n",
    "    number of rows and column on each side of the input features maps.\n",
    "    In this case, the output has the same dimension as the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Non Linearity (ReLU)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the convolution operation, the output is subject to an\n",
    "activation function to allow non-linearity. The usual activation\n",
    "function for convnet is the Relu. All the pixel with a negative value\n",
    "will be replaced by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Max-pooling operation\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is easy to understand. The purpose of the pooling is to reduce\n",
    "the dimensionality of the input image. The steps are done to reduce the\n",
    "computational complexity of the operation. By diminishing the\n",
    "dimensionality, the network has lower weights to compute, so it prevents\n",
    "overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, you need to define the size and the stride. A standard\n",
    "way to pool the input image is to use the maximum value of the feature\n",
    "map. Look at the picture below. The \"pooling\" will screen a four\n",
    "submatrix of the 4x4 feature map and return the maximum value. The\n",
    "pooling takes the maximum value of a 2x2 array and then move this\n",
    "windows by two pixels. For instance, the first sub-matrix is\n",
    "\\[3,1,3,2\\], the pooling will return the maximum, which is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/tensorflow/20_CNN_v7_files/image012.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another pooling operation such as the mean.\n",

    "-   Fully connected layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step consists of building a traditional artificial neural\n",
    "network as you did in the previous tutorial. You connect all neurons\n",
    "from the previous layer to the next layer. You use a softmax activation\n",
    "function to classify the number on the input image.\n",

    "**Recap:** \n",
